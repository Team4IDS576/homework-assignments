    " -  Import the torchtext IMDB dataset and do the following:\n",
    "   -  Build a  Markov (n-gram) language model.\n",
    "   -  Change the output and the model appropriately in _[Simple Sentiment Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis)_ (also available [here](https://github.com/thejat/dl-notebooks/blob/master/examples/rnn/Seq2Seq_RNN_Simple_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb) where the imports have been slightly modified) to build an LSTM based language model. Plot the training performance as a function of epochs/iterations.\n",
    " -  For each model, describe the key design choices made. Briefly mention how each choice influences training time and generative quality.\n",
    " -  For each model, starting with the phrase \"My favorite movie \", sample the next few words and create an approx. 20 word generated review. Repeat this 5 times (you should ideally get different outputs each time) and report the outputs.\n",
    " - Note: make any assumptions as necessary."
