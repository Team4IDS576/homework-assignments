This line of reasoning  is analogous to the [distributional hypothesis of word meanings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics). For words, this roughly translates to words that appear in similar sentences should have similar vector representations. For movies, vectors for two movies should be similar if they are watched by similar people.\n",
