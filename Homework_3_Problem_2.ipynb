    "\n",
    " -  Train the sequence to sequence model ([Model 1](https://github.com/thejat/dl-notebooks/blob/master/examples/rnn/Seq2Seq_Translation_Example.ipynb)) for a language pair (excluding French-English), where the output is English and the input is a language of [your choice](https://www.manythings.org/anki/).\n",
    " -  Now train another model (Model 2) for the reverse (i.e., from English to the language you chose). In this model, use the GloVe 100 dimensional embeddings. See notebook 4, cell 2 for an [example](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis) while training.\n",
    " -  Input 5 well formed sentences from the English vocab to Model 2, and input the resultant translated sentences to Model 1. Display all model outputs in each case.\n",
    " - Note: make any assumptions as necessary."
